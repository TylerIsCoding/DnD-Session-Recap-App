<p>Quest Log is a web application that leverages Google OAuth for user authentication. The application enables users to create and manage session notes, recaps, and any other information they need to store.</p>

<h2>How It's Made</h2>
<p><strong>Tech Used:</strong> MongoDB, Mongoose, Express.js, Handlebars, Node.js, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript</p>
<br>
<p>
This project utilizes a combination of technologies to create a dynamic and interactive website. Here's a breakdown of the tech stack and their respective roles:

- HTML5: Provides the structural elements and content for the website.
- CSS3: Handles the styling and layout of the website, ensuring an aesthetically pleasing design.
- JavaScript: Implements interactive features like the navigation bar and form validation, enhancing user experience.
- MongoDB and Mongoose: Enables the storage of documents, collections, and user data in a structured manner.
- Node.js and Express.js: Hosts the server to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- Handlebars: Serves as the template engine, facilitating the creation of dynamic web pages.

To ensure a seamless user experience across devices, a responsive design approach was adopted, guaranteeing that the website looks great on all screen sizes.

<h2>Optimizations</h2>
<p>Here are some ways that I could increase performance on my website:

These are some popular methods of optimization that I am considering:
- Database Indexing: Analyze the database queries and identify frequently accessed fields or columns. Implement appropriate indexes on these fields to improve query performance.- Optimized all images by reducing their file size and using correct image formats
- Caching: Utilize caching mechanisms, such as Redis or Memcached, to store frequently accessed data in memory. This can reduce the load on the database and improve response times.
- Asset Bundling: Consider bundling your static assets (CSS, JavaScript) into a single file to reduce the number of HTTP requests required to load the page. This can enhance performance, particularly for larger projects with multiple assets.
- Lazy Loading: Implement lazy loading techniques for images and other non-critical assets. This way, they will only be loaded when they come into the viewport, improving initial page load times.
- Code Optimization: Review your codebase for potential performance bottlenecks, such as inefficient algorithms or unnecessary iterations. Optimize these areas to improve the overall efficiency of your application.
- GZIP Compression: Configure your server to enable GZIP compression for responses. This reduces the size of data sent over the network, resulting in faster page loading times.
- CDN Usage: Leverage content delivery networks (CDNs) to serve static assets from geographically distributed servers. This can reduce latency and improve the loading speed of your website.
- Database Query Optimization: Optimize your database queries by ensuring they are properly indexed, avoiding unnecessary joins, and utilizing query optimization techniques specific to your database technology.
- Browser Caching: Configure appropriate caching headers for static assets, allowing browsers to cache them locally. This reduces the need for repeated requests, improving performance for returning visitors.

Quest Log is still a work in progress and will be optimized before I consider it complete. This is a minimum viable product at the moment.

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>This is the first application that I have written that uses authentication. I have learned a considerable amount creating this project so far.

- I used Mongoose and Handlebars for the first time. This really has made a huge difference in how I will create full-stack applications in the future.
- This is one of the first real MVC applications I have written and the MVC paradigm makes all the difference when it comes to project organization.
- The importance of performance optimization and website accessibility
- The importance of testing and debugging in the development process
- The significance of keeping up with the latest web development technologies and trends
- The benefit of using version control with Git and hosting the code on Github</p>
